/**
 * The service is a publicly invocable ordinary Java object. All of its
 * public methods, either <i>instance or static,</i> can be invoked by remote
 * JVMs. It is recommended to use this class as a wrapper, exposing specific
 * methods of its internal utility objects. It is normally completely unaware
 * of the <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net>cajo</a>
 * <a href=http://weblogs.java.net/blog/cajo/archive/2007/09/simple_interjvm.html>
 * grail</a> framework.
 * <br>It can use its <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/Cajo.html>
 * Cajo</a> member reference to find and interact with other services. A
 * service being an atomic element of functionality, could belong to multiple
 * {@link AbstractService service}s.<br>
 * All service object instances must assume that they will be used in a
 * multi-threaded <i>(i.e. reentrant)</i> environment, therefore protection
 * of non-threadsafe code regions is essential.

    * client JVM <i>(e.g. controller.Controller)</i> it can be either
    * hard-coded, read from a file, or a system property.<br>
    * <i><u>NB</u>:</i> The controller argument can be null, if the service
    * wishes to provide no controller, nor GUI for clients.
    * @param name The name under which to bind the service in the local
    * rmi registry. These services can be then accessed through their
    * registry URL <i>(e.g. //myhost:1198/main)</i>.<br>
    * <i><u>NB</u>:</i> If a service already exists under this name, this
    * service will replace it.
    * @param log The output stream to write the service invocation events,
    * if this argument is null, the events will be written to System.out
    * <br><i><u>NB</u>:</i> it is <i>highly</i> recommended to build oos
    * atop a BufferedOutputStream, and if a lot of invocations are being
    * logged, possibly a ZippedOutputStream as well. The stream could be from
    * a socket, if logging to another machine is desired. The same stream
    * can be used by multiple services.

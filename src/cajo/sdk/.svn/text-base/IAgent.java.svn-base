/**
 * This interface defines the fundamental method of a <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net>
 * cajo</a> service agent. An agent is sent from one service to another, to
 * operate locally at it. This is to both reduce network traffic, and improve
 * performance. As an agent needs to know its receiving service interface, or
 * at least part of it: an agent is typically custom-built, for a particular
 * receiving service class.

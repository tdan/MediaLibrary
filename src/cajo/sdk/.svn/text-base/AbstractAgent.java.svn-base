/**
 * The agent is a piece of executable code, sent from one {@link
 * AbstractService service} to run locally at another. It is the logical
 * converse of a controller object. It is normally used either when a
 * client has to interact frequently with a service, so as to minimise
 * network traffic; or if the receiving service operates operates on large
 * data sets, to prevent having to send large amounts of data over the
 * network. Conceptually, a general purpose agent could belong to several
 * different services.<br>
 * <i><u>NB</u>:</i> Not all service objects accept agents, as a malicious
 * agent could crash the service JVM e.g. by excessive memory allocation.
 * They are primarily accepted in well known domains, where the agents are
 * trusted, <i>or</i> where the agent class definitions are already in the
 * classpath of the server.

/**
 * The view is a base class of graphically interactive control objects.
 * Normally views are completely <i>unaware</i> of the existence of their
 * controller objects, and of the <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net>cajo</a>
 * framework entirely; potentially the same view could be used by multiple
 * {@link AbstractController controller} objects. It is intended as a
 * <i>'skin'</i> to a controller object, easily interchangeable with another.
 * A given {@link AbstractService service} could optionally provide multiple
 * views. Its purpose is to move the computational requirements of data input
 * and presentation, off the server, to the client. A view can even be used
 * as a monitor, configuration, or debug screen, for other objects which are
 * interacting directly with its controller object.
 * <br><i><u>NB</u>:</i> It is possible, but not recommended, for the view to
 * interact directly with its service.

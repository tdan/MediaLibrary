/**
 * The controller is the smart go-between for its serice object. It is used
 * primarily to offload server workload and local storage related to the
 * support of the client. As a controller object must know its {@link
 * AbstractService service} in detail, typically a controller belongs
 * exclusively to one service.
 * <i><u>NB</u>:</i> Much as with service objects, a controller should
 * assume that it will be used by multiple service threads, <i>concurrently,</i>
 * therefore synchronisation of non-threadsafe code regions is essential.

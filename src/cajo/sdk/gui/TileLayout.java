/**
 * A rather unique and very powerful LayoutManager. In addition to laying out
 * components relative to the container, it also supports layout relative to
 * components <i>within</i> the container. Its purpose is to support
 * arbitrarily complex component layouts, of an unlimited number of
 * components, within a single container. It can easily create complex layouts
 * that would otherwise require many subpanels, and multiple standard layout
 * managers. It also can create layouts that are actually <i>impossible</i>
 * to do with standard layout managers. These features make this layout
 * manager extremely flexible, and makes advancedlayouts perform extremely
 * fast. It just may be, the last and only LayoutManager you'll ever need.
 * <p>Components can be laid out above, below, left, right, or overlapping
 * either a referenced component in the panel, or to the panel itself. Its
 * width and height can be specified with similar flexibility. Absolute and
 * proportional bounds are also supported. In typical use, one or more
 * reference components <i>(i.e. tiles)</i> are laid, and the rest of the
 * components are set relative to them. Only visible components in the panel
 * are laid out, allowing for interesting affects by modifying visibility
 * at runtime.
 * 
 * <p>Usage example:<blockquote><tt><pre>
 *    panel.add(new JLabel("hello"), new Object[] {
 *       TileLayout.LEFTINDENT, TileLayout.NOOFFSET,
 *       TileLayout.PROPWIDTH,  TileLayout.FULLHEIGHT,
 *       refComponent, new Insets(-5, 10, 5, 10),
 *       new Rectangle(0, 0, 333, 0) // proportion rectangle 33.3%w
 *    });
 * </tt></pre></blockquote>
 * 
 * <p>Up to four alignment constraints can be specified, their order does not
 * matter:
 * 
 * <p><ul>
 * <li> Positioning constants for indent, offset, width, and height
 * <li> A Component for placement relative to, otherwise the container
 * <li> A Rectangle for fixed and proportional component bounds
 * <li> Insets to trim the resulting component boundaries
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><i>NB:</i> The JRE <i>draws</i> components from last added
 * to first; but the manager sizes them first to last. Therefore, in order to
 * layout relative to another component, the reference component must be
 * added <i>before</i> the dependent one. This is critically important when
 * components are laid out on top of others, or overlapping. This is a
 * <i>super nice</i> capability of this layout manager.

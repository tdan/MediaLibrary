/**
 * This interface defines the canonical methods to be furnished by <i>all</i>
 * <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net>cajo</a> controllers. As a receiving
 * object needs to know the controller's interface, or at least part of it;
 * typically receivers need to be custom-built to handle specific types of
 * controllers. <i>(much as to use its sending service)</i>
 * <p>Controllers may be passed between services, however, they would
 * normally need to be sent wrapped in a <tt>java.rmi.MarshalledObject.</tt>
 * The receiver would then call the <tt>get()</tt> method, to extract the
 * controller object. This is necessary to preserve the information necessary
 * for the client to find the needed remote class definitions.
 * <p>In addition to the effort for defining a good quality API, similar
 * effort should be put into the javadoc. Develop it from the viewpoint that
 * the controller interface documentation is all a client should need, to
 * fully understand how to use the service, via its controller.
 * <p><i><u>NB</u>:</i> This client-facing interface need not bear <i>any</i>
 * resemblance to the service object it represents, as it can provide
 * composite functionality for its client.

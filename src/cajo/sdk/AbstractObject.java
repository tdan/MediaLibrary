    * This utility function dynamically casts a service, sent agent,
    * or received controller reference, into a local interface. The provided
    * interface can implement as much, or as little, of the provided object's
    * public methods <i>(instance and static)</i>as needed. A dynamic proxy
    * created by this method can be passed between JVMs, if needed.
    * <br><i><u>NB</u>:</i> methods can be invoked either synchronously, or
    * asynchronously. The difference depends simply on the type of method
    * return specified. If the actual type of the return is used in the
    * interface, the method will block until completion as expected. However,
    * if a <a href=http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html>
    * java.util.concurrent.Future</a> is specified, the invocation will
    * return immediately, with the Future object. The future can be
    * periodically checked to see when the invocation is done, and get the
    * result. This is <i>very useful</i> for methods which require lengthy
    * time to complete, so as not to delay other thread processing.
    * @param <T> The local interface to be implemented by the returned
    * dynamic proxy, the method signatures need not match exactly, but must
    * be logically compatible, under the rules of the language
    * @param object A reference typically to a service, received controller,
    * or sent agent, or its local proxy
    * @param localInterface The local class of an interface of interest
    * <i>(e.g. somepkg.SomeInterface.class)</i>
    * @return An object implementing the interface provided, yet passing
    * the method invocations directly onto the object reference
    * <br><i><u>NB</u>:</i> If any of the arguments passed onto a remote
    * invocation are not serialisable, or the result is not; those objects
    * will be transparently replaced with dynamic proxies, implementing all
    * of the remote object's interfaces. Hence the practice of using
    * interfaces, rather than classes, in method signatures is recommended.
    * <br>A local dynamic proxy can even be created with a local interface,

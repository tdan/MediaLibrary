/**
 * The logger is used to instrument an object for invocation logging
 * purposes. It is intended as a replacement for ordinary or RMI logging, in
 * that this logger is aware of the Invoke package methodology, and can
 * decode it to automatically provide context. Specifically, it will gather
 * information about the calling client, the method called, the inbound and
 * outbound data, and the approximate time used to service the invocation.<p>
 * This type of class is very useful for both clients, and services. Clients
 * can wrap remote service references in a logger, to observe their
 * interaction, and the corresponding results. Services can wrap their
 * local references to observe how clients are using them.
 * <p><i><u>NB</u>:</i> Logging may be activated and deactivated
 * administratively as needed on an instance basis via the field
 * {@link #OFF OFF}, and forcibly enabled on a class-wide basis via the
 * static field {@link #DEBUG DEBUG}.
